Hi! My names Jenna, otherwise known as polyrain. I'm a Software Engineer working at Clipchamp. I graduated from the University of Queensland with my Bachelor's of Engineering (Hons) with first class honors. I like to make interesting software projects that can help people live the best lives possible.

<br/>

I currently spend most of my spare time playing through games on my PSTV, doing game development, or listening to music. If you want to get in touch with me about one of my projects, or want to ask me some questions, email at the link below!
