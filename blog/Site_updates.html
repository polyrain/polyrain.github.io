Hi!<br /><br />
2020 has been a wild year so far. From finishing up work at Canva, to a global pandemic, to concluding my second last
semester at university, it’s been a pretty insane time. But that doesn’t mean I haven’t been able to work on personal projects!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="what-have-i-been-doing-this-year"><em>What have I been doing this year?</em></h2>

<p><br /></p>

<p>To answer that question, you need to tell me where to start! In these last 6 months I’ve learnt a fair amount of <a href="https://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>, a functional programming language (aka a completely different paradigm to what you’re usually used to with programming!). I’ve been studying this at UQ, mainly because I wanted to try some new things, but also because I really did want to round out my final year with cool stuff rather than more monotony. 
<br />
In the last month, I’ve made some pretty serious progress on unox (check out my <a href="https://polyrain.github.io/projects.html">projects page for more on that</a>), and should be done with the client side application for it by the start of August, assuming things go to plan. It’s been interesting seeing the different quirks there are to something like ncurses, but overall it’s still probably my favorite side project at this point in time (besides this site!).
<br /><br /></p>

<h2 id="where-is-2020-headed"><em>Where is 2020 headed?</em></h2>
<p><br />
That is something I’m not sure about. We’ll see, I guess; it’s still too early in the year to be sure what is or what isn’t going to happen. 
<br /><br />
Until next time,
<br /><br />
