_The future of this site is going to be quite exciting_

As I find more time,
I intend to rewrite the website to be more... reactive, so to speak. Currently,
the website doesn't fare so well on mobile platforms; this is the first
major change that will be addressed. 


As we continue into the year, I intend to post updates on my personal projects,
namely unox and bingobongo, and once the site redesign has been completed
we should have a platform that is ideal for use by all. Stay tuned!
