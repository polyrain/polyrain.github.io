Hello!
<br />
Welcome to yet another blog post from yours truly. Haven’t been posting as much due to being caught up with study for the final course I had to do for semester one this year; shout out to Machine Learning stuff (I will never forget what a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">MLP is now!</a>). With semester one drawing to a close, it’s time to set sights on what the second half of this very… <em>interesting</em> year has in store.
<br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="semester-2">Semester 2</h2>
<p><br />
I’ll be concluding my 4 year sentence to the software engineering hurdles this year! One final surge is all that’s needed, and I expect to be posting updates to the various final projects I have to complete; namely, my VR thesis game! Currently this game is still in middling development, but the next few weeks (in between some tedium for the final stuff I have to do be considered a “real engineer”) will see some pretty rapid development happening as the content and main game loop become realized. Keep an eye on this site (or my twitter!) to keep up w/ it.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>In other news, got a Vortex Race 3 keyboard, and my god has this rapidly improved my QoL for development. After ~3 years of using anything from a Razer Blackwidow to my MBP’s keyboard, having a keyboard that feels this nice is such a breath of fresh air. Very pleased with this purchase, and would reccomend anyone sitting on the fence of buying a new keyboard to just take the dive.</p>

<p><br />
Finally, just want to give a shoutout to one of my closest friends, riley davis, who just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gChX19ijPx0">dropped his latest EP</a> in combination with an amazing artist who has animated the entire thing. Check it out if you have the time, and want to treat your ears!</p>

<p><br />
<br /></p>

<p>That’s it for this post, stay safe out there y’all.
